# Tourist Accommodations Map

An interactive web application that visualizes tourist accommodation data by census section in Spain, using data from the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE).

## Project Overview

This application provides a visual representation of tourist accommodation distribution across Spain, showing the density of tourism accommodations by census section. Users can filter the data by province, municipality, and accommodation count ranges.

## Directory Structure

- `data/` - Contains input data files and processed output
  - `input/` - Place raw data files here (see README in that directory)
  - `output/` - Contains processed GeoJSON files (generated by scripts)
- `data-processing/` - Data processing scripts and utilities
  - `scripts/` - Python scripts for data processing
- `webapp/` - The web application
  - `src/` - Source code files
  - `dist/` - Compiled application (generated)

## Required Software

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for the web application)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8 or higher (for data processing)
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Fast Python package installer and resolver

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tourist-accommodations-map.git
cd tourist-accommodations-map
```

### 2. Install UV (if not already installed)

```bash
pip install uv
```

### 3. Set Up the Python Environment

```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download Required Data

Follow the instructions in `data/input/README.md` to download the necessary data files from the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE).

### 5. Process the Data

```bash
uv run data-processing/scripts/convert_excel_to_csv.py
uv run data-processing/scripts/merge_shapes_with_csv.py
```

### 6. Build and Run the Web Application

```bash
cd webapp
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The application should now be available at http://localhost:3000/

## Important Note About Running Python Scripts

Always use `uv` to run Python scripts in this project for faster execution and better dependency management:

```bash
uv run path/to/script.py
```
