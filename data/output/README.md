# Data Output Directory

This directory will contain the processed data files generated by the data processing scripts. These files are not included in the repository due to their large size, but will be generated automatically when running the data processing scripts.

## Expected Output Files

After running the data processing scripts, the following files should be generated in this directory:

1. `secciones_with_shapes.geojson` - The main GeoJSON file containing the census sections with tourist accommodation data
2. Other intermediate files that may be generated during the data processing workflow

## How to Generate These Files

To generate these files, you need to:

1. First, download the required input data files as described in the `data/input/README.md` file
2. Run the data processing scripts from the project root:

> **Important**: Always use `uv` to run Python scripts in this project for faster execution and better dependency management.

```bash
# Convert Excel data to CSV
uv run data-processing/scripts/convert_excel_to_csv.py

# Merge shape data with tourist accommodation data
uv run data-processing/scripts/merge_shapes_with_csv.py
```

The web application will automatically use the generated GeoJSON file from this directory.
